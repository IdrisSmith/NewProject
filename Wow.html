<p class="wow"><b> World of Warcraft is a massive online multiplayer game, based around completing quests and combating other players. There are over 20 races
  for a player to choose, each one belonging to one of the three alliances that fight for control of Azaroth, the world's map. Over 100 million
  people have played this game, and with the new expansion that came out in August, even more will join. World of Warcraft is called the king
 of MMORPGs for it's replayability and how it's expansions help keep the game fresh. Even after 12 years, 7 million people still play
  Warcraft daily.</b></p>
  <p class="wow"><b>Warcraft was the game that solidified Blizzard as a serious company in videogames. Coming out in 2004, it was revolutionary for its time.
    Many MMORPGs had came out before Warcraft but no other game was as big and as exciting. The world of Azaroth has so many diverse characters
    and quests, nothing else came close. No other Blizzard game has had as many players and as much support.
  WoW's lore was so interesting, they made a movie called "Warcraft" which premiered in June 2016. To read more about World of Warcraft,
