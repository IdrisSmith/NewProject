  <p class="o"> Overwatch is an incredibly diverse game, with over 30 fantastic heroes for you to play as. From giant, hammer-swinging knights,
    to the edgiest man on earth, there is a hero for everyone to enjoy. Every hero has a variety of unique abilities that allow them to combat
    eachother in fun and exciting ways. You have 4 classes of heroes to choose from, attack, defense, tank, and support. Attack heroes specialize
    in infiltrating defenses and dealing massive damage. Defense heroes can protect the objectives the attacking team is trying to win. Tank heroes
    have lots of health and absorb damage for their teammates. Support heroes heal their teammates, allowing them to continue fighting.Probably the
     most iconic character in the game, Tracer, is shown on the game's box. Her tagline, "Cheers Love, Cavalry's Here" has become somewhat of a
     motto for the game. To read about these heroes, <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/heroes/">click here.</a></p>
     <p class="o"> The game has 4 different game modes, objective, objective-payload, payload, and king of the hill. In objective your task is to either
       defend or attack 2 objective and to capture it by being inside it or protecting the objective by fending off attackers. Objective-payload
       is very similar, it starts with an attacking team capturing an objective, and if successful, a vehicle of some kind is able to be moved, and
       your new objective is to push the payload to its destination while defenders attack you. Payload is a longer version of the second half
       of objective-payload. King of the hill has both teams attack the same objective, instead of one attacking while the other defends. All four
       of these game modes come with 3 maps to play on, with a total of 13 maps, with a new map that came out on September 6th.</p>
