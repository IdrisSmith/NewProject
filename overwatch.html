  <p class="o"> Overwatch is an incredibly diverse game, with over 30 fantastic heroes for you to play as. From giant, hammer-swinging knights,
    to the edgiest man on earth, there is a hero for everyone to enjoy. Every hero has a variety of unique abilities that allow them to combat
    eachother in fun and exciting ways. You have 4 classes of heroes to choose from, attack, defense, tank, and support. Attack heroes specialize
    in infiltrating defenses and dealing massive damage. Defense heroes can protect the objectives the attacking team is trying to win. Tank heroes
    have lots of health and absorb damage for their teammates. Support heroes heal their teammates, allowing them to continue fighting.Probably the
     most iconic character in the game, Tracer, is shown on the game's box. Her tagline, "Cheers Love, Cavalry's Here" has become somewhat of a
     motto for the game.</p>
