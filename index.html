  They started off in Irvine, California in 1991 under the name Silicon & Synapse. First Blizzard was focused on
  creating ports for other games. In 1992 they produced their first game, The Lost Vikings. This game was created
for Super Nintendo and had a sequel in 1987. 1996 saw the release of one of Blizzard's most popular series, Diablo.
Diablo originally came out for the PlayStation, and has seen 2 sequels. What Blizzard is most known for is the World of Warcraft series,
which came out in 2004 for PC. WoW has had many updates since then to make it a more exciting and challenging game. Hearthstone, a Blizzard made

out with an extremely successful game called Overwatch. Overwatch is a teambased FPS that currently has over
